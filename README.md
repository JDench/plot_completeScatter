# plot_completeScatter
This function can be used to generate a scatterplot for set of categorical data you want to compare.  The categorical data is assumed to have two nested categories, and plots each sub category sequentially, with the hierarchial categories side-by-side for comparison.  It was designed to quickly give me publication ready plots for competitive fitness data.
